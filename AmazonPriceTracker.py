"""
A quick project where I can get a url from an amazon page, and then given credentials and a price range,
it will email the user when the item falls under the price range
Things to do:
Get information from amazon page
Get user's information
Send email
Do I want it running every hour? Do I need to write a script to have it turned on when computer turns on
In email, sending the url as a link, not just as a string
